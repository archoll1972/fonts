            <p><img class="objectwo" src="http://www.cesarjuarez.com/images/vegas2284.jpg"> Welcome to Fonts Project Part 2. On the right, an image from Las Vegas, taken back in 2005 during my attendance to the NAB convention. After the events from October 1, 2017, its inclusion on this project made complete sense to me since my photo's point of view is from the same area that is now a crime scene.</p>
            <p>Hello Tony, I hope you like the final layout of the page. I wanted to practice a bit more with colours, so I added a personal palette. Also, I am experimenting with classes on HTML and CSS. I hope you enjoy the look as much as I did creating it.</p>
            <p>Upon completion of the pages, I left wondering if there is a CSS instruction that will allow us to maintain original images ratio and let the program do an auto-resizing without creating a class and its calling on CSS. My guess would be creating a JS file for that.</p>
            <p>Did you know that the <a class="mylink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum" target="_blank"> Lorem Ipsum </a> is derived from a philosophical work by the Roman orator Cicero? The text is in Latin, however it is scrambled, which means that it was edited from the original; words are missing and sentences do not make much sense. When translating them to English, it is a (very) boring reflection on human behaviour. </p>
            <p>Thanks for reading. I shall look forward for our next class project. Good luck!</p>
